# Mongo Soical Network API

This assignment we were tasked with creating a simple social network-esque api for use within a social network web app, however instead of using SQL like we have in the past, we learned to use MongoDB and its ORM mongoose. I really enjoyed this assignment, working with MongoDB and mongoose is a breeze, and mongo's Compass GUI was alos helpful for doublechecking my work. Virtuals are also a great tool for (in our case) getting quick aggregate data about one of our models. The operators available with mongoose are also really powerful, we used the `$addToSet` operator which is a super powerful tool to add to an array within a model.
